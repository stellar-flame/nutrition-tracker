# TODO 
1. CI/CD pipelines (Path B) – automate image builds and S3 deploys.
2. HTTPS via ALB + ACM and CloudFront – secure the stack.
3. Observability (Path C) – logging, metrics, alarms.
4. Auth for real users (Path D) – Cognito or JWT-based auth.

# Done
1. Simple EC2 - S3 deployment
2. Containers 
   * EC2
   * ECS - Self Managed
   * ECS - Fargate
3. RDS + schema + FastAPI integration (what we discussed earlier).
